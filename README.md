## Building From Source

**Warning:** This is a *MonoGame for Windows* project, so I can't guarantee, nor have I tested, that this software runs under anything other than Windows.

Building a MonoGame project can be quite tricky. The Content Pipeline from XNA isn't quite there yet and you will most likely get errors trying to build from source without it.
Therefore, if you want to successfully build the project, follow the tutorial from [RB Whitaker's 'Setting Up XNA' tutorial](http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/setting-up-xna). Once you
have done that, building from source *should* be as easy as opening the project and hitting 'Run'. If you hit a snag, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:christian.broomfield@posteo.de) and I'll try my best to help.
